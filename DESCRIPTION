Description: Cross-platform utilities for prompting the user for credentials or a 
    passphrase, for example to authenticate with a server or read a protected key.
    Includes native programs for MacOS and Windows, hence no 'tcltk' is required. 
    Password entry can be invoked in two different ways: directly from R via the 
    askpass() function, or indirectly as password-entry back-end for 'ssh-agent' 
    or 'git-credential' via the SSH_ASKPASS and GIT_ASKPASS environment variables.
    Thereby the user can be prompted for credentials or a passphrase if needed 
    when R calls out to git or ssh.
